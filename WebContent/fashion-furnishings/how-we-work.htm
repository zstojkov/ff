								The first consultation is free of charge for local clients.
								Later consultations may be charged depending upon travel time and expenses incurred.
								<br><br>
								The purpose of the initial consultation is to:
								<table>
								<tr><td>-</td><td>Survey existing soft furnishings, decoration and furniture, colour, shape and size of rooms,
													and take measurements required for the estimates</td></tr>
								<tr><td>-</td><td>Establish customer preferences in style colour schemas</td></tr>
								<tr><td>-</td><td>Exchange ideas about type, style and colour of curtains, blinds or other room decoration 
													(pelmets, cushions, throws…)</td></tr>
								<tr><td>-</td><td>Establish budget level for fabrics and making</td></tr>
								<tr><td>-</td><td>Discuss delivery dates</td></tr>
								</table>
								<br>
								Based on the initial consultation we will produce estimates for the making and fabric quantities. 
								<br><br>
								Next phases will follow after the customer approval.
								<br><br>
								Please bear in mind that the cost can go up or down depending on a final choice of design, fabrics, patterns, lining… 
								All changes are always communicated to and approved by customers.

									The most satisfying part of Gordana's work is to design and produce things that her clients 
									love and to exceed their expectations. She gives her individual attention to each client, discussing their ideas, taking measurements 
									and bouncing ideas around. As a result, our clients are delighted to find their ideas have been transformed into their ideal 
									room decoration or outfit - giving them confidence in their own style and ideas. Gordana's experience and knowledge of fabrics 
									ensures that all styles and budgets are catered for, with every client benefiting from the personalized service. 
									<br><br>
									We have established close working relationships with several interior designers and we are happy 
									to refer clients for broader advice on decoration or interior design, if required.  Equally, we am ready 
									to work with your own Interior Designer or directly with home owners who want a more individual, 
									bespoke solution to their interior decoration.

								We also maintain a substantial range of samples available at my workshop to choose from
								or to help you in decisions on colour schemes, 
								while sample books from other ranges can be provided on demand.
								<br><br>
								Of course, you are very welcome to supply your own fabrics for curtains, roman blinds or cushions.

							<br><br>
							For local clients delivery is usually free. Additional delivery charges may be incurred for oversized items
