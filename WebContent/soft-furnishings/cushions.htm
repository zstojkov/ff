		<h1 class="pagename">Decorative Cushions</h1>

		<br>
		Cushions can be made in a range of styles and sizes; for everyday use on a suite or in a conservatory, 
		or for decoration on a bed or as large floor cushions or bean bags in a children's playroom. 
		I mix and match styles and shapes to create stunning effects and to give texture and added interest to a neutral interior.
		<br><br>
		"Decorative cushions are the simplest and the most economical way to bring colour and texture to any room. 
		A plain sofa may magically become a focal point, if you decorate it with unusual or exotic cushions." (Interior Designer)
		<br><br>
		I also offer fitted cushions in the form of boxed pads for window seats, bolsters, or seat pads for benches or chairs. 
		All of my cushions are made to order and can suit either a modern or traditional scheme and can be either piped or plain. 
		Pads are offered in bespoke sizes and can be made from feather, foam or polyester.  I am also able to offer coordinated 
		throws made from fake fur or quilted to match a scheme. Get in touch to discuss your specific requirements.
